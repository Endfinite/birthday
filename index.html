    <h1>Hey, you</h1>
    <p>I know you have seen this already but I have absolutely no idea how to give you a better gift. Just
      hope that you
      will like this. I don't know how its going to turn out. In any case it's for you. :)</p>
    <div class="image1"><img src="./smol Julia.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <p>Look! you as a child. All cute and vulnerable, and you are still cute and vulnerable. Nothing has
      changed all
      these years.
      You still look the same...kind of</p>
    <div class="image2"><img src="./julllll.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <p>You have faced live's many trials to transform from one to another and I do wonder what you will
      transform in
      coming years. Whatever shape you take, externally or internally, I wish people will still find you beautiful.
      May the decision you take aligns both with your mind and soul. I wish you enough strength to take right decision
      and if you do not, I wish you have enough support around you take the next step. Your birth has impacted lives of
      many around you and to some that are thousands of miles away. You have lived for 22 years now. Not bad for someone
      who faces an existential crisis frequently. Cheers to that! In these 22 years of life, you have accomplished many
      things like... wait, I had to think for a while. Like bumping into a pole (always comes first into my mind),
      hitting your thighs into a pole again, missing the train, missing a bus, missing tika (whoever that is), missing
      1/4 of the hair that used to be, missing a connection between friends (ouch). You have brighten up a home, just
      look around you sometimes. Loved blindly, provided laughter, shared joy, Listened to a stranger, cared for your
      friends, and on the verge of becoming a doctor. You take all the things with you, that you may consider bad as
      well as good side and into the next step of your life. You are going to make the best of it. There is no one like
      you and there will never be. I am glad that I got to meet you in some way. Either I am going to be a story that
      you tell your grandchildren or a reality, only time will tell but one thing I know for sure is that Julia, I
      greatly appreciate you in my life. You have taught me many things and you have shown me love, even if it may sound
      impossible to some outsider. You know, the fear of loving too much, the fear of rejection, the fear of living your
      life in full. I truly wish that they will vanish with tomorrow's warm morning sun. Easier said than done yet I
      somehow think you could live like you've always wanted. I truly wish you an abundance of courage and love.
      Somehow, I think these are the only two things required to live life in full and one do not come without the
      other. All things said and done, your reality is where you are right now. I do not want to strain your already
      tired brain. Thank you taking the time to read this. Its not much of a gift really but I tried to make something
      special for you. Enjoy your birthday, Julia. Many many happy returns of the day and merry christmas!
